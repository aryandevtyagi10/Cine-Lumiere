Cinelumeria - Movie Recommender System

Cinelumeria is a movie recommendation system built using Streamlit, which allows users to receive personalized movie suggestions based on genre similarity. 

Users can select a movie from a curated list and discover five similar movies using cosine similarity between genre features.
